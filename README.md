## Skype Chat Viewer

### Purpose
This tool can be used to view old Skype Chats from old computers!   
If you know you have a working Skype Instance there you should firstly export the chat before
connecting this computer to the internet!   
I made this tool to make it easier to view the exported chats, I didn't find any other tool which
could render the chat like a "real" chat.   
> :warning: ATTENTION: This tool works only with old skype versions!

### Exporting your old Skype Account
- The data is located at `%appdata%\Skype\your_profile_folder`.
- You can backup the whole directory, but for reading the chats you only need to export the `main.db`-file.
- You can open this file then with this tool or copy this file to the same directory of this tool and it opens automatically!
